<p>This camera is special to me because I purchased it during my first trip to Tokyo in December 2017. While this camera is great and has a Carl Zeiss lens, it's price point at about $1,000 now makes it a bit over rated. The Yashica T5 which can be bought for less than half the price of this camera, is a better choice. I'll never sell this camera because of the memories attached to it,  but there are better alternatives for the money you would pay for one today.</p>
